#Ethereum Private Blockchain Tinkering:

Guidlines for getting connected to the private network.

##Overview.

 The network consists of Raspberry pi with dhcp server (ip address `192.168.0.1`) running a go-ethereum node initated with the `genesis.json` file (not mining).
 The intent is to create a network of local computers over which a private blockchain can be created. To help do this, follow the guidance below for different clients:
 
 ##Instructions for Go-ethereum "geth":
 
1. Install go-ethereum or other client; https://ethereum.github.io/go-ethereum/install/
2. Establish ethernet connection to pi - connect cable to switch (or wifi to router) and make sure network interface "obtains IP address automatically" in your adapter settings.
3. Save the below as a file called `genesis.json`

```json
{
  "alloc": {},
  "nonce": "0x0000000000000042",
  "difficulty": "0x020000",
  "mixhash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "timestamp": "0x00",
  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "extraData": "0x",
  "gasLimit": "0x2fefd8"
}
```

*This defines the genesis block for the private blockchain. This must be the same for all participants*

4. On command line run, `geth init /path/to/your/genesis.json`
   *This initialises the first block. You are now primed to connect to the priveate Ethereum p2p network*
5. Now do:
       `geth --networkid 12345 --port 33333`
   *This connects establishes the link (TCP) for your machine in the local network. The networkid and port were arbitrarily chosen when I set up the pi. N.b. `--verbosity 5`  will give lots of messages about the network and what is going on.*
   If unsuccessful, check your firewall (allow connections on TCP port 33333).
6. Next, in a new command window (leave the other one open):
       `geth attach`
  *This gives you a javascript console to interact with; a `>` prompt*
7. Next do:
       `admin.addPeer("enode://6c461262a4cdb658d7852af41a433668dea467da87168390d02e22c6191fc136063a7df859e46a65786de6c3f73670f00d2378b5e17ec3142a84ded8029e1728@192.168.0.1:33333")`
  This creates the first Peer to Peer link and results in a connection to the RPi. The address enodeURL was taken from the RPi's node.
8. Do `admin.peers` to check, you should see a list of connected peers.
9. `personal.newAccount("yourPassword")` to create a new accoount - it will give you a hex format accnt no
10. `miner.setEtherbase("yourAccount")`
11. `miner.start()`
    *this will start mining, with the rewards going to your account. You are now in a position to start playing with smart contracts on the private network!*
12. To send a transaction

`eth.sendTransaction(<amount to send here, e.g. 100000000>, {from:eth.accounts[0],to:"0X<insert account no>,gas:3000000})`

Or open a UI, e.g. mist
